#Share media to email

This is a simple glass mirror api that shares your media to an email. 

You can share to flickr, dropbox, ifttt, etc

**Coder?** Check out the goodies in [app/](https://github.com/harperreed/glass_share/tree/master/app)

###Inspiration


Inspired by the need for a way to share media without going to plus. Also [@obra](http://twitter.com/obra) kept sharing to flickr from his glass and i wanted to do the same. 


###Usage

1. Go to: [https://glass-share.appspot.com/](https://glass-share.appspot.com/)
2. Login with your glass enabled account. 
3. Enter your email address
4. Share media with the contact called `GlassShare`
5. &nbsp;
6. Profit (or images shared to that email address)

####Protips:

* [Email a photo to flickr](http://www.flickr.com/account/uploadbyemail/)
* [Email media to tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/email_publishing)
* [Email media to Dropbox](http://www.labnol.org/software/upload-dropbox-files-by-email/18526/) (**ghetto**)
* [Email file to almost anything (ifttt)](https://ifttt.com/channels/email/triggers/25)

###Thoughts on the mirror API

* Confusing
* Apps shouldn't have to be contacts.
